üî• Deep Learning for Face Anti-spoofing

This is the official repository of **Deep Learning for Face Anti-Spoofing: A Survey**, a comprehensive survey 
of recent progress in deep learning methods for face anti-spoofing (FAS) as well as the datasets and protocols.


## Introduction
We present a comprehensive review of recent deep learning methods for face anti-spoofing (mostly from 2018 to 2021). It covers hybrid (handcrafted+deep), pure deep learning, and generalized learning based methods for monocular RGB face anti-spoofing. It also includes multi-modal learning based methods as well as specialized sensor based FAS. It also presents detailed comparision among publicly available datasets, together with several classical evaluation protocols.

We will update this page on a regular basis! So stay tuned~ :tada::tada::tada:
